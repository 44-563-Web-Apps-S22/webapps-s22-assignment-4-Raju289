    <p class="stage-direction">Ah! you jade, you wretch!</p>

    <h6 class="name TOI"> TOI. (_pretending to have knocked her head_).</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">Bother your impatience!
        You hurry me so much that I have knocked my head against the
        window-shutter.</p>

    <h6 class="name ARG"> ARG. (_angry_).</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction"> You vixen!</p>

    <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6> (_interrupting_ ARGAN). <p class="stage-direction"> Oh!</p>

        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> Be silent! you baggage, and let me scold you.</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> Well! that’s too bad after what I have done to myself.</p>

        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">You make me bawl till my throat is sore, you jade!</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> And you, you made me break my head open; one is just as bad as
            the other; so, with your leave, we are quits.</p>

        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG. </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">What! you hussy....</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">If you go on scolding me, I shall cry.</p>
        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG. </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">To leave me, you....</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> Oh!
        </p>
        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG. </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">You would....</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI. </h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> Oh!</p>
        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> What! shall I have also to give up the pleasure of scolding her?</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">Well, scold as much as you please; do as you like.</p>
        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">You prevent me, you hussy, by interrupting me every moment.</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> If you have the pleasure of scolding, I surely can have that of
            crying. Let every one have his fancy; ’tis but right. Oh! oh!</p>
        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction">I must give it up, I suppose. Take this away, take this away, you
            jade. Be careful to have some broth ready, for the other that I am to
            take soon.</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> This Mr. Fleurant and Mr. Purgon amuse themselves finely with
            your body. They have a rare milch-cow in you, I must say; and I should
            like them to tell me what disease it is you have for them to physic
            you so.</p>
        <h6 class="name ARG">ARG.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> Hold your tongue, simpleton; it is not for you to control the
            decrees of the faculty. Ask my daughter Angélique to come to me. I
            have something to tell her.</p>
        <h6 class="name TOI">TOI.</h6>
        <p class="stage-direction"> Here she is, coming of her own accord; she must have guessed your
            thoughts.</p>
